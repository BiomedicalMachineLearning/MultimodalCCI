# MMCCI - Multimodal Cell-Cell Interaction Integration and Analysis

**MMCCI** is a Python package for integrating and visualizing CCI networks within and between multiple modalities at the level of the individual LR pair. MMCCI provides network and clustering visualizations as well as insightful downstream analyses, including network dissimilarity scoring and permutation testing for comparison between biological conditions, LR pair clustering, cell-type pair LR querying, and pathway analysis.
